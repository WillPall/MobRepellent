MobRepellent v0.1 - a Bukkit plugin

* What is MobRepellent?

    MobRepellent is a plugin for the third-party Minecraft server project
    Bukkit (http://bukkit.org). MobRepellent allows players to construct
    "repellers" that will prevent hostile mobs from spawning within a certain
    distance.

* How do I use MobRepellent?

    Simply drag MobRepellent.jar into your Bukkit /plugins directory.
    MobRepellent will automatically create all the necessary files.

    Once the plugin is loaded, to create a repeller you'll need 7 diamond
    blocks (not diamond gems). First, using five diamond blocks, construct a
    shape that looks like a plus sign (+) parallel with the ground. Next,
    place the remaining two diamond blocks directly above the block in the
    center of the plus sign.

    After the repeller is constructed, no hostile mobs will spawn within a 200-
    block cube of the base of the repeller. To remove the repeller, simply
    remove one of the diamond blocks that is part of the repeller.

* Known issues

    - Multi-world support is not available (creating a repeller in one world
      will repel mobs in the same coordinates in all worlds). This is a minor
      issue (with major consequences) that will be fixed in the next update.

* Todo list

    - Fix multi-world support
    - Add Permissions support
    - Add configuration file (config.yml)
    - Add configuration option to select block type for repellers
    - Add configuration option to define distance to repel mobs

* License and Reuse

    I don't really feel like including all kinds of crazy license info or
    requiring any derivatives to use a specific license. I'm lazy, so I hereby
    relenquish all copyrights and any other rights to this software and the
    source material. Do what you want with it. If you use any of this in one of
    your own projects (although I can't see why you would), send me an email.
    I'd love to hear about it.
