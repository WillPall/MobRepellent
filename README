MobRepellent v0.4.4 - a Bukkit plugin

* What is MobRepellent?

    MobRepellent is a plugin for the third-party Minecraft server project
    Bukkit (http://bukkit.org). MobRepellent allows players to construct
    "repellers" that will prevent hostile mobs from spawning within a certain
    distance.

* How do I use MobRepellent?

    Simply drag MobRepellent.jar into your Bukkit /plugins directory.
    MobRepellent will automatically create all the necessary files.

    Once the plugin is loaded, to create a repeller you'll need 7 iron,
    gold, or diamond blocks. First, using five blocks, construct a shape
    that looks like a plus sign (+) parallel with the ground. Next, place the
    remaining two diamond blocks directly above the block in the center of the
    plus sign.

    After the repeller is constructed, no hostile mobs will spawn within a
    cuboid radius of the base of the repeller. For instance, if the radius is
    50 blocks, it will repel in a 100x100x100 cube centered at the base of the
    repeller. To remove the repeller, simply remove one of the blocks that is
    part of the repeller.
    
    Default repeller types and radii:
        - Small - Iron block - 20 block radius
        - Medium - Gold block - 30 block radius
        - Large - Diamond block - 50 block radius

* Console/Admin Commands

    NOTE: Since permissions are not yet implemented, these commands can be
          used by any player.
    
    /mrlist - Lists all currently loaded repellers
    /mrreload - Reloads the configuration file

* Configuring MobRepellent

    You can configure MobRepellent to use almost any block type instead of
    the default blocks. You can also configure MobRepellent to use any radius
    to repel mobs. On the first run of the plugin, MobRepellent will
    automatically create a config.yml file with the default values. See the
    sample config.yml file for more information:
