MobRepellent v0.2 - a Bukkit plugin

* What is MobRepellent?

    MobRepellent is a plugin for the third-party Minecraft server project
    Bukkit (http://bukkit.org). MobRepellent allows players to construct
    "repellers" that will prevent hostile mobs from spawning within a certain
    distance.

* How do I use MobRepellent?

    Simply drag MobRepellent.jar into your Bukkit /plugins directory.
    MobRepellent will automatically create all the necessary files.

    Once the plugin is loaded, to create a repeller you'll need 7 diamond
    blocks (not diamond gems). First, using five diamond blocks, construct a
    shape that looks like a plus sign (+) parallel with the ground. Next,
    place the remaining two diamond blocks directly above the block in the
    center of the plus sign.

    After the repeller is constructed, no hostile mobs will spawn within a 200-
    block cube of the base of the repeller. To remove the repeller, simply
    remove one of the diamond blocks that is part of the repeller.

* Known issues

    - The 200-block cube is a little too large for most needs. This will be
      fixed with the introduction of the configuration file.

* Todo list

    - Add Permissions support
    - Add configuration file (config.yml)
    - Add configuration option to select block type for repellers
    - Add configuration option to define distance to repel mobs
    - Add options for creating multiple strength repellers (ie. a repeller
      constructed out of iron blocks that repels for a smaller amount than a
      repeller constructed of diamond blocks)
