MobRepellent v0.7.0 - a Bukkit plugin

* What is MobRepellent?

    MobRepellent is a plugin for the third-party Minecraft server project
    Bukkit (http://bukkit.org). MobRepellent allows players to construct
    "repellers" that will prevent hostile mobs from spawning within a certain
    distance.

* How do I use MobRepellent?

    Simply drag MobRepellent.jar into your Bukkit /plugins directory.
    MobRepellent will automatically create all the necessary files.

    Once the plugin is loaded, to create a repeller you'll need 7 iron,
    gold, or diamond blocks. First, using five blocks, construct a shape
    that looks like a plus sign (+) parallel with the ground. Next, place the
    remaining two diamond blocks directly above the block in the center of the
    plus sign.

    After the repeller is constructed, no hostile mobs will spawn within a
    cuboid radius of the base of the repeller. For instance, if the radius is
    50 blocks, it will repel in a 100x100x100 cube centered at the base of the
    repeller. Neutral mobs are not blocked by default, but this can be
    configured in the config.yml. MobRepellent does not affect mob spawners,
    hostile nor passive. To remove the repeller, simply remove one of the
    blocks that is part of the repeller.
    
    Default repeller types and radii:
        - Small - Iron block - 20 block radius
        - Medium - Gold block - 30 block radius
        - Large - Diamond block - 50 block radius

* Console/Admin Commands

    All console commands default to OP-only.
    
    /mrlist - Lists all currently loaded repellers
    /mrreload - Reloads the configuration file
    /mrremove [repellerNumber] - Removes the selected number as found in the
                                 list given by /mrlist. Does not remove the
                                 repeller structure.
    /mrremoveall - Removes all currently loaded repellers. Does not remove the
                   repeller structure.

* Configuring MobRepellent

    You can configure MobRepellent to use almost any block type instead of
    the default blocks. You can also configure MobRepellent to use any radius
    to repel mobs, and select which mobs to repel and which to ignore. On the
    first run of the plugin, MobRepellent will automatically create a
    config.yml file with the default values. See the sample config.yml file
    for more information:
    
    https://github.com/WillPall/MobRepellent/raw/master/docs/config.yml

* Todo list

    - Custom repeller shapes (admin defined structures)
    - Add visual cue that repeller is working. Possibly with the top block on
      fire (as suggested by darklust). This will be configurable and probably
      default to off.
      
* Known Issues

    - Config file cannot be reloaded (/mrreload) in-game
    - Config file not correctly created on first-run of plugin
    - Damage values for blocks (e.g. orange wool), doesn't work
    - Squid don't spawn near repellers
    
* Changelog

    Version 0.7.0 (DEVELOPMENT - Use at your own risk)
        - Basic functionality restored for CraftBukkit 1.2.3-R0.2 (#2060)
        - Removed glowstone from restricted blocks, added mycelium, end stone
        - Introduced small configuration file bugs (must stop server, edit
          file, restart server for changes to take effect)
        - Introduced (re-introduced?) bug with squid being blocked from
          spawning, regardless of configuration options

    Version 0.6
        - Added configuration option to select which mobs to repel

    Version 0.5.2
        - Stopped repellers from blocking spawners. One, a repeller makes a
          dungeon seem like a cake-walk, and also many servers use passive
          mob spawners to provide resources for players.

    Version 0.5.1
        - Bugfix for mobs being mean and deciding to keep spawning no matter
          how many times I told them not to (thanks Jaiph!)

    Version 0.5
        - Added Permissions support!!
        - Added two new commands for managing repellers
        - Enabled configuration to select certain block types such as colored
          wool or cracked stone brick

    Version 0.4.4
        - Bugfix for repellers not loading correctly if the chunk becomes
          loaded and then unloaded
        - Removed auto-checking for repeller existence because of Bukkit
          issue #656
        - Bugfix for repellers just plain not working
        - (Hopefully) final bugfix for egg spawning
        - Bugfix for unnecessary 'block_id = -1' line in config.yml
        - Bugfix for incorrect plugin version in plugin.yml

    Version 0.4.3
        - Added admin/console commands for listing repellers and reloading
          configuration files
        - Bugfix for egg spawning
        - Possible bugfixes for blocking entity spawning

    Version 0.4.2
        - Added delay to loading repellers until all other plugins have
          loaded. Hopefully this will solve any problems with the plugin
          looking for repellers in worlds that haven't been loaded.
          
    Version 0.4.1
        - Possible bug fix for loading/saving repellers
        - Allow spawning chickens from eggs, even if neutral mobs are blocked

    Version 0.4
        - Added support for multiple repeller types with different radii.
        - Added option to also repel neutral mobs (default: false)
        - Added notification when creating or destroying a repeller

    Version 0.3
        - Added configuration file with support for selecting repel radius
          and repeller block type
        - Lowered default radius from 100 blocks to 50 blocks

    Version 0.2
        - Added multi-world support (WOOHOO!)

    Version 0.1
        - Uploaded first version
