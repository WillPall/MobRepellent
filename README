MobRepellent v0.3 - a Bukkit plugin

* What is MobRepellent?

    MobRepellent is a plugin for the third-party Minecraft server project
    Bukkit (http://bukkit.org). MobRepellent allows players to construct
    "repellers" that will prevent hostile mobs from spawning within a certain
    distance.

* How do I use MobRepellent?

    Simply drag MobRepellent.jar into your Bukkit /plugins directory.
    MobRepellent will automatically create all the necessary files.

    Once the plugin is loaded, to create a repeller you'll need 7 diamond
    blocks (not diamond gems). First, using five diamond blocks, construct a
    shape that looks like a plus sign (+) parallel with the ground. Next,
    place the remaining two diamond blocks directly above the block in the
    center of the plus sign.

    After the repeller is constructed, no hostile mobs will spawn within a 100-
    block cube of the base of the repeller. To remove the repeller, simply
    remove one of the blocks that is part of the repeller.

* Configuring MobRepellent

    You can configure MobRepellent to use almost any block type instead of
    diamond blocks. You can also configure MobRepellent to use any size radius
    to repel mobs. On the first run of the plugin, MobRepellent will
    automatically create a config.yml file with the default values. See the
    sample config.yml file for more information:

* Todo list

    - Add Permissions support
    - Add options for creating multiple strength repellers (ie. a repeller
      constructed out of iron blocks that repels for a smaller amount than a
      repeller constructed of diamond blocks)
    - Add configuration option to also block neutral mobs from spawning
